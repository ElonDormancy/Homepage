# **RESEARCH EXPERIENCES**

#### *Quantum Information and Quantum Computing Seminar*

Learned the QCQI theory through different methods

+ Solved the rotation path problem on Bloch sphere via quaternion method

---

#### *Experimental study of quantum information processing in the ion trap system*

Determined whether the ions($\ge2$) chain is "cold" from carrier transition and blue band transition

+ Derived the formula of population after carrier transition and blue band transition

+ Used Python programming to obtain the mean vibrational quantum number and Rabi frequency

Preparation of entangled state through Mølmer–Sørensen gate

+ Derived of the evolution of the density matrix of two ions and state occupation under the drive of red and blue detuned lasers via series expansion/phase space method
+ Used Python programming to obtain optimal fidelity and the minimum time for Mølmer–Sørensen gate

---

#### *Quantum Spin Systems and Quantum Computation(Simulation)*

Used Python and C++ programming to simulate the evolution process of electron spins in NMR system with large scale by using Chebyshev polynomial method

Developed a high-performance universal quantum simulator with MPI that can easily build quantum circuits and map them to various physical systems[such as NMR,Ion Trap,Superconducting and so on]

Designed a Javascript program to make it extremely easy to build quantum circuits and simulate universal quantum circuit
